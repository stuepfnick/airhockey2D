Unity 2D Airhockey Game

You can play a WebGL build on my webspace:
https://stuepfnick.macbay.net/airhockey2d/

It is not completely finished, game never ends and there is no main menu, just made it out of curiosity of how to create an easy, but yet effictive "AI" opponent.

Can be played with mouse or touch devices. Have fun!
